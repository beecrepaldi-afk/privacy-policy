  <h1>VerbaDiem Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 25, 2024</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>VerbaDiem</strong> application ("we," "us," or "our"), developed by <strong>Beatriz Crepaldi</strong>, handles your information. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>VerbaDiem is designed to respect your privacy. We do not require you to create an account, and we <strong>do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable data</strong>, such as your name, email address, or location.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Data Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
  <p>For the app to function correctly and save your progress, some information is stored directly on your device using the browser's local storage. This data includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your learning progress (learned words, XP, level).</li>
    <li>Your current and longest streak.</li>
    <li>Unlocked achievements.</li>
    <li>Your language settings.</li>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>To provide all app features, VerbaDiem utilizes the following third-party services. Each service has its own privacy policies regarding how they handle data.</p>

  <h3>3.1. Google Gemini API</h3>
  <p>The core of the VerbaDiem learning experience is powered by Google's Gemini API. To generate daily words, etymologies, example sentences, and conduct guided practice sessions, the app sends certain non-personal information to Google. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The native and target language preferences you have selected.</li>
    <li>The daily word being learned.</li>
    <li>Sentences you type during practice sessions for evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is processed by Google to provide the AI's responses. We recommend you review the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a> to understand how they manage data.</p>

  <h3>3.2. Google AdSense</h3>
  <p>To support the development of the app, we display advertisements provided by <strong>Google AdSense</strong>. AdSense may use cookies and device identifiers to collect non-personal data and serve ads more relevant to you.</p>
  <p>For more information on how Google uses data in its advertising products, please visit:

  <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
  <p>The application <strong>does not request access</strong> to your camera, microphone, location (GPS), contacts, or any other sensitive device permissions.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>VerbaDiem is <strong>not intended for children under the age of 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can take necessary action.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
